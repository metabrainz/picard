   * Save ASIN and release country to ID3 tags. (#2484, #2456)
   * Variable %country% renamed to %releasecountry%.
   * Save release country to MP4 and WMA tags.
   * Don't take unsupported tags into account when checking if the
     tags are 'complete' and the file should have 100% match. This
     fixes problems with showing the green check-marks for file
     with limited tag formats, like MP4 or WMA.

Version 0.9.0alpha7 - 2007-04-14
 * New Features

   * Lowercase the extension on file renaming/moving. (#2701)
   * TaggerScript function `$copy(new,old)` to copy metadata from
     variable `old` to `new`. The difference between `$set(new,%old%)`

     flattening them.
   * Added special purpose TaggerScript variable `%_id3:%` for direct
     setting of ID3 frames. Currently it supports only TXXX frames in format
     `%_id3:TXXX:<description>%`, for example:

     removed, try to find an existing directory in the same path.
