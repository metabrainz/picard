MusicBrainz Picard
==================

[MusicBrainz Picard](http://picard.musicbrainz.org) is a cross-platform (Linux/Mac OS X/Windows) application written in Python and is the official [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org) tagger.

Picard supports the majority of audio file formats, is capable of using audio fingerprints ([AcoustIDs](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/AcoustID)), performing CD lookups and [disc ID](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Disc_ID) submissions, and it has excellent Unicode support. Additionally, there are several plugins available that extend Picard's features.

When tagging files, Picard uses an album-oriented approach. This approach allows it to utilize the MusicBrainz data as effectively as possible and correctly tag your music. For more information, [see the illustrated quick start guide to tagging](http://picard.musicbrainz.org/docs/guide/).

Picard is named after Captain Jean-Luc Picard from the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation.
