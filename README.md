[MusicBrainz Picard](http://picard.musicbrainz.org) is a cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) audio tagging application. It is the official [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org) tagger.

Picard supports the majority of audio file formats, is capable of using audio fingerprints ([AcoustIDs](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/AcoustID)), performing CD lookups and [disc ID](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Disc_ID) submissions, and it has excellent Unicode support. Additionally, there are several plugins available that extend Picard's features.

When tagging files, Picard uses an album-oriented approach. This approach allows it to utilize the MusicBrainz data as effectively as possible and correctly tag your music. For more information, [see the illustrated quick start guide to tagging](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/quick-start/) and the [documentation](https://picard-docs.musicbrainz.org/).


## Features

- **Multiple formats:** Picard supports all popular music formats,
  including MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, WMA, WAV, and more.
- **AcoustID:** Picard uses [AcoustID](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/AcoustID)
  audio fingerprints, allowing files to be identified by the actual
  music, even if they have no metadata.
- **Comprehensive database:** Picard uses the open and
  community-maintained [MusicBrainz database](http://musicbrainz.org)
  to provide accurate information about millions of music releases.
- **CD lookups:** Picard can lookup entire music CDs with a click.
- **Plugin support:** If you need a particular feature, you can choose
  from a selection of available plugins or write your own.
- **Scripting:** A flexible and powerful, yet easy to learn, scripting language
  allows you to exactly specify how your music files will be named and how the
  tags will look like.
- **Cover Art:** Picard can find and download the correct cover art for your albums.
- **Open Source:** Picard is licensed under the
  [GNU General Public License 2.0](COPYING.txt)
  or later, and is hosted on GitHub where it is actively
  developed.
