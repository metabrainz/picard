How to Tag Files
================

This quick start guide describes how you can tag your files using
`MusicBrainz Picard`_.


#. Click **View**, and then click **File Browser**.
#. Drag a folder to the **Unmatched Files** folder in the right-hand
   pane.

#. Wait for Picard to process the files (the names will turn from grey
   to black) and then click the **Cluster** toolbar button to cluster
   files into album clusters.

#. Select a clustered album and click the **Lookup** toolbar button to
   look the cluster up. Depending on your previous metadata, album will
   show up in the right-hand pane. If an album shows up, go to step 7.
   Since you are a new Picard user, we recommend that you read the steps
   in between as well.

#. If nothing happened when you clicked the **Lookup** toolbar button,
   click the **Lookup** button in the bottom panel. Your default browser
   will open and allow you to find the right album manually.

#. Pay attention to the amount of tracks in each album, and pick the
   one you have. Click the |tagger_icon| icon.

#. Drag the clustered album onto the album that was just opened, if it
   didn't happen automatically.

#. Depending on your previous metadata, Picard will try to guess the
   matching tracks. The order is green > yellow > orange > red, where
   green is the best match. If you are seeing a lot of red and orange, it
   could mean that Picard has guessed wrong, or that your files didn't
   have a lot previous metadata to work with.

   If this is the case,
   it's recommended to click a track and compare the metadata using the
   **Original Metadata** and **New Metadata** panels at the bottom of
   picard window. If there is an incorrect match, simply drag & drop the
   track to its correct spot.

#. When you are satisfied with the matches, select the album you want
   to save and click on the **Save** toolbar button to save files.

#. A green check mark means the file is saved in its proper location.
