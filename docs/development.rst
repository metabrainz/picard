Development
===========

The source code of Picard is maintained in Git and you can get it with
all its history using:

::

    git clone git://github.com/musicbrainz/picard.git


or you can fork or clone the mirrored `repo from GitHub`_ in the
normal GitHub way. Pull requests and discussion on GitHub is generally
preferred and all such requests will be considered.

If you are interested in providing development assistance, contact us
by either posting on the `developers mailing list`_ or joining the
`#musicbrainz-devel` IRC channel on `irc.freenode.net`.

If you want to install Picard from source on Windows, there is
:ref:`Building Picard for Windows <build-windows>`.
Lukáš Lalinský provides `daily Picard builds for Windows`_,
if you want to test the latest development version of Picard on Windows.

For Mac there is :ref:`Building Picard on OS X <build-osx>`
and also `daily builds for OS X`_.
