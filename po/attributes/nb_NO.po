"<p>A single has different definitions depending on the market it is released "

"<li>In the US market, a single typically has one main song and possibly a "

"usually named after its main song; the single is primarily released to get "
"radio play and to promote release sales.</li>\n"
"<li>The U.K. market (also Australia and Europe) is similar to the US market, "
"however singles are often released as a two disc set, with each disc sold "
"separately. They also sometimes have a longer version of the single (often "
"combining the tracks from the two disc version) which is very similar to the "
"US style single, and this is referred to as a \"maxi-single\". (In some "
"cases the maxi-single is longer than the release the single comes from!)</"
"li>\n"
"<li>The Japanese market is much more single driven. The defining factor is "
"typically the length of the single and the price it is sold at. Up until "
"1995 it was common that these singles would be released using a mini-cd "
"format, which is basically a much smaller CD typically 8 cm in diameter. "
"Around 1995 the 8cm single was phased out, and the standard 12cm CD single "
"is more common now; generally re-releases of singles from pre-1995 will be "
"released on the 12cm format, even if they were originally released on the "
"8cm format. Japanese singles often come with instrumental versions of the "
"songs and also have maxi-singles like the UK with remixed versions of the "
"songs. Sometimes a maxi-single will have more tracks than an EP but as it's "
"all alternate versions of the same 2-3 songs it is still classified as a "
"single.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are other variations of the single called a \"split single\" where "
"songs by two different artists are released on the one disc, typically vinyl."

"Promotional in nature (but not necessarily free), mixtapes and street albums "
"are often released by artists to promote new artists, or upcoming studio "
"albums by prominent artists. They are also sometimes used to keep fans' "
"attention between studio releases and are most common in rap & hip hop "
"genres. They are often not sanctioned by the artist's label, may lack proper "
"sample or song clearances and vary widely in production and recording "
"quality. While mixtapes are generally DJ-mixed, they are distinct from "
"commercial DJ-mixes (which are usually deemed compilations) and are defined "
"by having a significant proportion of new material, including original "
"production or original vocals over top of other artists' instrumentals. They "
"are distinct from demos in that they are designed for release directly to "
"the public and fans; not to labels."
