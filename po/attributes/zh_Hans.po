"<p>A single has different definitions depending on the market it is released "
"for.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>In the US market, a single typically has one main song and possibly a "
"handful of additional tracks or remixes of the main track; the single is "
"usually named after its main song; the single is primarily released to get "
"radio play and to promote release sales.</li>\n"
"<li>The U.K. market (also Australia and Europe) is similar to the US market, "
"however singles are often released as a two disc set, with each disc sold "
"separately. They also sometimes have a longer version of the single (often "
"combining the tracks from the two disc version) which is very similar to the "
"US style single, and this is referred to as a \"maxi-single\". (In some "
"cases the maxi-single is longer than the release the single comes from!)</"
"li>\n"
"<li>The Japanese market is much more single driven. The defining factor is "
"typically the length of the single and the price it is sold at. Up until "
"1995 it was common that these singles would be released using a mini-cd "
"format, which is basically a much smaller CD typically 8 cm in diameter. "
"Around 1995 the 8cm single was phased out, and the standard 12cm CD single "
"is more common now; generally re-releases of singles from pre-1995 will be "
"released on the 12cm format, even if they were originally released on the "
"8cm format. Japanese singles often come with instrumental versions of the "
"songs and also have maxi-singles like the UK with remixed versions of the "
"songs. Sometimes a maxi-single will have more tracks than an EP but as it's "
"all alternate versions of the same 2-3 songs it is still classified as a "
"single.</li>\n"

"songs by two different artists are released on the one disc, typically vinyl."

"<p>单曲根据发行市场的不同有不同的定义。</p>\n"

"本；单曲通常以主歌命名；这首单曲的发布主要是为了获得电台播放和促进发行销售。"
"</li>\n"
"<li>英国市场（也包括澳大利亚和欧洲）与美国市场类似，但单曲通常以两张唱片的形"
"式发行，每张唱片单独销售。他们有时也会有一个较长的单曲版本（通常是将两张唱片"
"不同版本的歌曲组合在一起），这与美国风格的单曲非常相似，这被称为“最大单曲”。"
"（在某些情况下，最大单曲比单曲的发行时间还要长！）</li>\n"
"<li>日本市场更注重单曲，决定因素通常是单曲的长度和售价。直到1995年，这些单曲"
"都普遍使用迷你CD格式发行，基本上就是一张直径通常为8CM的小型CD。大约在1995年，"
"8CM的单曲光盘基本被淘汰，取而代之成为主流的是标准的12CM单曲CD；一般来说，1995"
"年以前发行的单曲，即使最初发行的是8CM格式，重新发行时也会采用12CM格式。日本的"
"单曲通常会有这些歌曲的器乐版本，也有像英国这样的混合版本的最大单曲。有时候一"
"张超级单曲会比一张EP包含更多的曲目，但因为它是由相同的2-3首歌的交替版本组成"
"的，所以它仍然被归类为单曲。</li>\n"

"歌曲，通常是黑胶唱片。</p>"
