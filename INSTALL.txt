Before installing Picard, you need to have these:

 * Python 2.6 or newer (Picard will not work with Python 3)
   http://python.org/download

 * PyQt 4.5 or newer
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

 * Mutagen 1.22 or newer (1.23 or newer for AIFF support)
   https://bitbucket.org/lazka/mutagen/downloads

 * gettext
   Windows: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gettext.htm

 * a compiler
   Windows should work with Visual C++ 2008 Express:
   http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7729279

 * chromaprint (optional)
   For fingerprinting (scanning) files
   http://acoustid.org/chromaprint

 * python-discid or python-libdiscid (optional)
   Required for CD lookups.
   https://python-discid.readthedocs.org/
   Depends on libdiscid: http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid
   Due to slowdowns in reading the CD TOC, using libdiscid versions
   0.3.0 - 0.4.1 is not recommended.

 * argparse (Python 2.6 only, required)
   Required for command-line arguments parsing
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse
   NOTE: it is included in Python >= 2.7 and Python >= 3.2


On Windows it is recommended to use Pip for Windows:
https://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/python/pip-for-windows
and then just:
  pip install mutagen
  pip install discid
there for Mutagen and python-discid.

The binaries for Python, GetText (msgfmt), fpcalc and discid.dll have to be
in the %PATH% on Windows.


Installation
------------

After installing the dependencies, you can install Picard by running:

  sudo python setup.py install

This will automatically build and install all required Python modules.
On Windows you need to have Administrator rights, but don't put "sudo"
in front of the command.
To start Picard now you can use:

  picard


Running From the Source Tree
----------------------------

If you want to run Picard from the source directory without installing, you
need to build the C extensions and locales manually:

  python setup.py build_ext -i
  python setup.py build_locales -i

And to start Picard use:

  python tagger.py


Running the Test Suite
----------------------

To run the included tests, follow the instructions for "Running From
the Source Tree".  Afterward you can run the tests using setup.py:

  python setup.py test

Alternatively, use a test runner such as nose.
