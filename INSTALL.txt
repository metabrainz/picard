MusicBrainz Picard Installation
===============================

Dependencies
------------

Before installing Picard, you need to have these libraries:

 * Python 2.6 or newer (Picard will not work with Python 3)
   http://python.org

 * PyQt 4.5 or newer
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
   http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/

 * Mutagen 1.20 or newer
   http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/

 * libdiscid (optional)
   Required for CD lookups.
   http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid
   Due to slowdowns in reading the CD TOC, using versions 0.3.0 - 0.4.1 is not
   recommended

Installation
------------

After installing the dependencies, you can install Picard by running:

  sudo python setup.py install

This will automatically build and install all required Python modules. To
start Picard now you can use:

  picard


Running From the Source Tree
----------------------------

If you want to run Picard from the source directory without installing, you
need to build the C extensions and locales manually:

  python setup.py build_ext -i
  python setup.py build_locales -i

And to start Picard use:

  python tagger.py


Running the Test Suite
----------------------

To run the included tests, follow the instructions for "Running From
the Source Tree".  Afterward you can run the tests using setup.py:

  python setup.py test

Alternatively, use a test runner such as nose.
